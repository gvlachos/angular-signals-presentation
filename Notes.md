# Angular Signals

Angular Signals are a new, highly efficient way to manage state and reactivity in Angular applications. Unlike traditional change detection, signals allow fine-grained updates, meaning the UI updates only where needed resulting in better performance, especially for complex applications. They’re simpler than RxJS for many state management use cases, reducing the learning curve and improving developer productivity. With stable support in Angular 17+, adopting signals can lead to faster, more maintainable applications with less boilerplate code.

## Angular Signals vs. RxJS: Key Differences & Comparison

| Feature                  | Angular Signals                                                    | RxJS                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose                  | State management and reactivity                                    | Reactive programming and streams                                                         |
| Learning Curve           | Lower                                                              | Higher                                                                                   |
| Granularity of Updates   | Fine-grained                                                       | Coarser                                                                                  |
| Boilerplate Code         | Minimal                                                            | More extensive                                                                           |
| Performance              | Optimized for UI updates                                           | General-purpose, may require tuning. Great for async but can trigger unnecessary updates |
| Use Cases                | Local state, simple reactivity                                     | Complex streams, advanced scenarios                                                      |
| Change Detection         | Works seamlessly with Angular’s Zone-less change detection         | Can require manual optimizations (e.g., async pipe, take(1))                             |
| Async Handling           | Designed for synchronous state updates, with limited async support | Natively handles async operations (e.g., API calls, user input, WebSockets)              |
| Integration              | Built into Angular (17+)                                           | Requires additional library                                                              |

## When to Use What?

✅ Use Angular Signals if:

    You need simple and synchronous state management.

    You want fine-grained, performant UI updates without unnecessary re-renders.

✅ Use RxJS if:

    You’re working with asynchronous data streams (e.g., WebSockets, API calls).

    You need complex event processing.
